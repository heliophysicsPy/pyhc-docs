PyHC Documentation Hub
======================

Welcome to the PyHC Documentation Hub! This is a centralized resource for searching across documentation for multiple Python Heliophysics Community (PyHC) packages.

The Python in Heliophysics Community (PyHC) is a community-driven organization promoting the use and development of open source Python packages for solar physics, heliophysics, and space science. This hub allows you to search across all core PyHC packages to find the documentation you need.
